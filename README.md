# Discrete-Time-Signal-Processing-II

This project main focus is on audio processing and image processing.

Section 1) Audio Processing

    - In this part noise & echo are added to a voice.
    - After conductins some processes, different filters are employed to cancel the noise (as much as possible) and delete the echo.
    
Section 2) Image Processing

    - Concept of kernels are introduced in this section.
    - Different kernels are used for some purposes each for their specific applications.
    - Kernels are employed to reconstruct an image.
    - Object detection using kernels.
